/// A logger that is local to each thread.
///
/// Logger as defined by the `log` crate is a global construct. A logger is
/// shared by the whole process and all of its threads. This makes sense for an
/// application.
///
/// However, a global logger is rarely useful for tests. `cargo test` creates
/// one process for each test source file, and runs each test method in a
/// separate thread. By default, logs of different tests will be mixed together,
/// which is less useful.
///
/// A similar problem exists in tests for `stdout` and `stderr`. Therefore,
/// `libtest` implemented something called `output capture`. Internally in crate
/// `std::io`, output `stdout` and `stderr` of a thread can be configured to
/// redirected to a sink of type `Arc<Mutex<Vec<u8>>>`. The sink is stored in a
/// `thread_local` variable. For each test method, `libtest` creates a sink
/// specific to the test and stores it in the main test thread. The output of
/// the main test thread will be redirected to the sink by `std::io`. Later in
/// `std::thread::spawn()`, when a new thread is created, the sink is copied to
/// the new thread's local variable. Thus, the output of the new thread is also
/// redirected to the same sink. That is how tests output are captured.
///
/// We took a similar approach by storing a logger in each thread, and copy the
/// logger to all sub-threads. Unfortunately we do not have access to methods
/// like `std::thread::spawn()`, thus the copying can only be done manually.
